** Data Ingestion, Split data (train/test), data cleaning
- Data ingestion as parquet (in columnar format for EDA)
- Split training data to be years 2015-2018, test data as 2019
- Data cleaning: 
    - Remove entries where cancelled = 1, diverted = 1, 
	  Dep_Delay = null or Arr_Delay = null
	-Remove outliers that are past 2-3 std dev (or by hand) 
	 (e.g. for Actual_Elapsed_Time, 1604 was max but ~800 was 2nd highest)

** First Model: Departure Delay
- Predict 0/1 outcomes (or probability of a delay in the case of logistic regression + threshold)
- Inference time to be 6 hours before CRS_Dep_Time (so only use features available at that point in time to do prediction for Dep_Delay) -- includes vars related to
   - time of year (year = continuous, day of month, month, day of week as categorical)
   - airline carrier, origin & destination airport (categorical)
   - Scheduled timing of flight (departure, arrival, elapsed)
      - transforming into categorical variables via binning by hours
   - interaction terms between day of week & CRS_Arr_Time
   - distance (continuous or categorical, experiment with both)   

** Second Model: Arrival Delay
- Predict 0/1 outcomes (or probability of a delay in the case of logistic regression + threshold)
- Inference time to be right after plane departure (taken off and is in the sky)
   - All variables in Departure Delay Model + others
   - Additional variables known at this point in time
       - variables specific to the actual departure (Dep_Time, Dep_Delay, etc) (categorical)
       - Taxi_out (specific to taxi time when departing)
	   - Specific delay variables (Carrier_Delay, Late_AircraftDelay, Security_Delay)
	       - all other delays are dependent on departure & arrival delays, so don't include when predicting arrival delay

** Encoding outcomes, Feature Transformations, Feature Selection
- Encoding Outcomes for both models (e.g. Boolean(Arr_Delay > 15))
   - defining any minutes delay or a more significant delay (e.g. greater than 15 minutes -- `Arr_Del15` & `Dep_Del15`)
   - enable model scoring (precision, recall, etc)
- Data Normalization & binning of variables
- Feature Selection -- can do via PCA, Lasso with our baseline models, forward/backward selection
