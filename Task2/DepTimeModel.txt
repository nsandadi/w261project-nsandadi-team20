Variables to predict Departure Delay (1/0)
Inference Time: 6 hours before CRS_Dep_Time

Year, Month, Day of week, Day of Month
- Day of Month -- include when we join on holidays
- Year by itself -- continuous variable
- Month by itself -- categorical 
- Day of week -- categorical

Unique_Carrer
- categorical

Origin-attribute
- categorical

Destination-attribute
- categorical

CRS_Dep_Time, CRS_Arr_Time
- If continuous: minutes after midnight
- If categorical: groups of 15 minutes, 30 minutes, or 1 hr (binning)
- can use continuous and/or categorical
- Interaction of Day of week with CRS_Dep_Time (by hr)
- Interaction of Day of week with CRS_Arr_Time (by hr) -- might not be useful, but can eval with L1 Norm

CRS_Elapsed_Time
- If continuous: minutes after midnight
- If categorical: groups of 15 minutes, 30 minutes, or 1 hr (binning)
- can use continuous and/or categorical

Distance & Distance_Group
- experiment with using either or
- have both categorical & continuous depending on which we want to use

Outcome: Boolean(Dep_Delay > 15)
